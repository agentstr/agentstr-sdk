Command Dispatcher
==================

This module provides a lightweight yet powerful dispatcher for "exclamation
commands" that are commonly used in chat-based user interfaces. It converts
messages such as ``!help`` or ``!deposit 100`` into asynchronous function calls
and returns a reply via *direct message* on Nostr.

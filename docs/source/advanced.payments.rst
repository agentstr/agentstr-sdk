Payments
========

`agentstr` has built-in support for handling payments via the Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) protocol. The :class:`~agentstr.relays.nwc_relay.NWCRelay` class provides an interface for sending and receiving payments.

This is integrated with the MCP server to allow for paid tools, where an agent can charge for the use of its services.

# Agentstr MCP Server Example

This example demonstrates how to create and run a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using the Agentstr SDK. MCP servers provide tools that agents can call to enhance their functionality.

#### To run it, first install the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Then start the local relay:

`agentstr relay start`

#### Then run it:

`python main.py`

#### You can now test the MCP server with the test_client.py script:

`python test_client.py`
